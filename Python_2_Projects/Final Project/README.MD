# Pitching and Hitting Statistics from Major League Baseball

## Abstract
When i started this project i set out to create a database with up to date player statistics from every team in the MLB.

## Purpose
The purpose of this python script is to give the user access to a database of MLB player data. Along with this it gives some sample query and output types that anothe user could use when using this script if they desired. I could have done a million things with the data collected and this code could easily be adapted to do those things if the user desiered. 

## Background/sources
A little bit of background on why i chose this topic and why i chose create this particular script:
* Baseball has been a part of my life since i was a little kid. Basically as long as i can remember. 
* Part of the fun of the game is being curious about specific players and their statistics.
