# MLB Scraping Project
This projects goal was to scrape html from a webpage using BeautifulSoup. I chose to scrape Major League Baseball statistics from espn.com. As you will see i created multiple csv's with the data and also provided an output on the program that gives the user the leaders for batting average(AVG) and strikeouts(K).

## Program Output
